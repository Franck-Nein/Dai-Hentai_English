# Dai-Hentai 3.0 English
## Cheap Google Translate Edition 
Go to releases for ipa.
## Overview
This project is an app that makes it easy for iOS devices to read, use, and collect the content of the e / ex hentai website. Since the content of this website is mostly viewed by adults, if you don't like the content, please don't use >x<, thank you.

Of course, regardless of the content, any questions about the code or use are welcome to suggest >w< 

After clicking on the thumbnails below, you can lead to YouTube to watch the video of the general function.

The overall user experience should be more stable and faster than 2.x, and the lock function is also added, so that everyone can be more at ease in use =w=

Thanks to the friends next door to have organized tags that can be found, so the conversion reference content here is from https://github.com/Mapaler/EhTagTranslator , thank you very much

## Windows / Linux no JB method  
Later [VVVVictorJ](https://github.com/VVVVictorJ) suggested that Cydia Impactor has no way to install it, you can use the [AltStore](https://altstore.io/), suggested by [shinrenpan](https://github.com/shinrenpan)

**One thing to note, this installation method has a seven-day limit period, and needs to be re-installed within the deadline.**

However, because it is a free account, there is only 100 minutes of trial for a month, and the cost is 0.05 mg per minute. The cost is too high. Those who have played can only say goodbye, and those who have not played can directly use the following IPA file...if possible O3Ob 
## The latest test version IPA

Because of laziness, I am too lazy to manually release the version every time, so I use a service that automatically produces ipa, which will operate whenever there is a new commit.

The identification of the version consists of a combination of two parts 
  * [Version number](https://github.com/DaidoujiChen/Dai-Hentai/blob/3.0_master/Dai-Hentai.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj#L1072)
  * [Build number](https://github.com/DaidoujiChen/Dai-Hentai/blob/3.0_master/Dai-Hentai.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj#L1067)

```
https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/dai-hentai-ipa/bitrise/{Version number}_{Build number}/Dai-Hentai.ipa
